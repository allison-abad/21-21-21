# 21 Savage
My first full stack web application created was a fan page for the rap artist 21 Savage. The assignment was to make the dislike button a.k.a thumbsDown button acknowledge the click counts the user would make and display the number on the client side.


## How It's Made:
**Tech used:**
* HTML
* JavaScript,
* Node.js,
* MongoDB/ Express.
* CRUD method 

## Lessons Learned:

Working on the 21 Savage full stack application taught me how important it is to always pay attention to pathnames, and keep consistency with changes and edits made in the server.js and main.js files.
